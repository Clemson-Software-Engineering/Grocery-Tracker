## Introduction
The current vision for this project is a free open-source web application that keeps inventory on the food you have in your home and will suggest if you need anything to buy. The goal of this project is to make grocery lists quickly and easily or plan out recipes no matter where you are. Since you know your inventory, this could be done at your home, your office, or even the grocery store. 

## Scope of functionalies
* Tell you the amount of each product you have
* Search specific products
* View all the products in the inventory (using different filters)
* Products you are low on or completely out of can be automatically transferred to your grocery list
* Add or remove products from the grocery list
	
## Technologies
* Back end (Planned): Java
* Front end (Planned): JavaScript, probably vanilla or react
	
## Project status
This project is just getting off the ground, so we do not have too much for additional contributors to do yet. However, we are very interested in any feedback or ideas that you may have, and we will let you know when there are more opportunities to contribute.

## Launch
Coming soon ...
