# Grocery-Tracker
Grocery Tracker project for Paige Rodeghero's CPSC 4720/6720

The current vision for this project is a free open-source web application that keeps inventory on the food you have in your home. When you use your food or buy more you will adjust the inventory accordingly. The application will be able to tell you the amount of each product you have, and you can view them all, search specific products, or view them by various filters. Products you are low on or completely out of can be automatically transferred to your grocery list. You can add or remove products from the grocery list. This is the perfect solution to be able to make grocery lists quickly or plan out recipes no matter where you are. Since you know your inventory, this could be done at your home, your office, or even the grocery store. 

This project is just getting off the ground, so we do not have too much for additional contributors to do yet. However, we are very interested in any feedback or ideas that you may have, and we will let you know when there are more opportunities to contribute. Our contributing guidelines file lays out how to report bugs, suggest new features, and much more. [[Contributing Guidlines]](CONTRIBUTING.md) If you do plan to contribute, we kindly ask you to follow our code of conduct which can be found in our GitHub repository or linked here.
